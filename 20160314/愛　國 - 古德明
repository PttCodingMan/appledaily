General John Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force in Europe during the First World War, was on a tour of inspection on the Western Front. Stopping at one of the camps that housed the wounded, he noticed a very bedraggled looking soldier sitting outside the camp.The general was just about to remark sympathetically about the soldier's condition, having noticed that he had one arm in a sling and a huge bandage about his head, when he heard the man mutter to himself:  "I love my country. I'd fight for my country. I'd starve and go thirsty for my country. I'd die for my country. But if ever this damn* war is over, I'll never love another country again!"第一次世界大戰期間，歐洲美國遠征軍司令約翰．珀欣將軍有一次巡視西部戰線，走到一個傷兵營前，停下來，看見營外坐着個蓬頭垢衣的士兵。他見那士兵一隻手以懸帶吊着，頭上裹着大繃帶，正想說些同情的話，卻聽見那士兵喃喃自語說：「我愛我的國家，會為之戰鬥，為之捱飢忍渴，為之身死。但是，假如這場他媽的戰爭有完結的一天，我決不會再愛一個國家了！」*這個加強語氣的damn，改為damned也可以。除了用在名詞之前，作形容詞，damn或damned還可用在形容詞之前，作副詞（adverb），例如：That is a damn / damned good idea（這個主意好得很）。
