Xerxes, the king of Persia, invaded Greece in  480 BC. According to the famous Greek historian Herodotus, the size of his expeditionary force was over two million men and four thousand ships. At the Hellespont, he caused a lofty seat to be set up on a hill from which he could survey them.When he saw the whole Hellespont hidden by his ships, and all the shores and plains thronged with men, Xerxes first declared himself happy, and presently he fell a-weeping.  "I was moved to compassion when I considered the shortness of all human life, seeing that of all this multitude of men not one will be alive a hundred years hence," he said.*The invasion ended in Xerxes' defeat.公元前四八零年，波斯王薛西斯犯希臘。據希臘著名史學家希羅多德說，其遠征軍人數超過二百萬，並有戰船四千艘。到了黑拉龐德海峽，薛西斯下令在高山之上，為他設一座位，以便俯瞰其軍隊。他看見黑拉龐德海峽為戰船遮蔽，海岸、平原都擠滿士兵，滿心歡悅溢於言表，但不久卻潸然下淚，說道：「想到人生之短促，想到一百年之後，這許多人將無一在世，我不能無感。」*這場侵畧戰爭，以薛西斯敗北作結。*《晉書》卷三十四載：名將羊祜登峴山，忽然有感，對同行者說：「自有宇宙，便有此山。由來賢達勝士，登此遠望，如我與卿者多矣，皆湮滅無聞，使人悲傷。」羊祜的感慨，和薛西斯大同小異。今峴山尚有墮淚碑，紀念羊祜事迹。
