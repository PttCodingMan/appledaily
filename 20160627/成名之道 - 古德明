Bernard Shaw's* name first became familiar to the general public as the result of scurrilous attacks, disguised as interviews, regularly made on him by a section of the London evening press. Extra-special reporters would force their way into Shaw's modest apartment, apparently for no other purpose than to bully and insult him.Many people wondered why he stood it. Why did he not kick the interviewers downstairs? Failing that why did he not call the police?  "I have kept my temper for 18 years,"  Shaw explained,  "and have never been uncivil to an interviewer."  Many felt that here was an astonishing example of Christian forbearance. Everyone talked about him.As a matter of fact, the interviews were written by Shaw himself.蕭伯納*的名字家喻戶曉，最初是因為倫敦有些晚報經常以訪問形式攻擊他，措詞下流。一些非常奇怪的記者，會闖入蕭伯納樸素的套房，為的似乎只是要欺侮蕭伯納。不少人都奇怪他為什麼忍受這樣的欺侮。為什麼不把訪問者踢下樓梯？而即使不踢之，為什麼不報警？蕭伯納解釋說：「我不發脾氣已有十八年，也從來不會對訪問者不禮貌。」不少人視蕭伯納為基督徒寬容的驚人典範。他成為大眾的話題。其實那些訪問稿都是蕭伯納自己寫的。*蕭伯納是英國著名劇作家，卒於一九五零年。
