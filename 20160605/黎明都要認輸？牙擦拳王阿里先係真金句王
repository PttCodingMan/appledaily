空肚食早餐、核心內圍定核心外圍？「黎天王」的金句雖然深入民心，但拳王阿里在擂台以外亦是金句王，名言多多的阿里曾經多次在不同場合讚自己帥，甚至說「我如此帥很難會謙虛」，又會揶揄對手哭的樣子難看，阿里金句絕對堅過「黎天王」。 「像蝴蝶般飛舞、像蜜蜂般螫刺，他雙手無法打到眼睛看不見的東西。」“Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. His hands can't hit what his eyes can't see.” 「不要數算著過日子，要讓日子過得有意義。」“Don’t count the days; make the days count.” 「當你像我一樣偉大時是很難去謙虛的。」“It's hard to be humble when you're as great as I am” 「一個人在50歲時對這個世界視野與他20歲一樣，他已經浪費了30年的生命。」“A man who views the world the same at 50 as he did at 20 has wasted 30 years of his life.” 「我討厭每一分鐘的訓練，但我說『別放棄，現在受苦然後餘生都以冠軍身份度過。』“I hated every minute of training, but I said, ‘Don’t quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion.'” 「因為膚色而憎恨別人是錯的。不論你憎恨的是哪一種膚色，這就是錯。」“Hating people because of their color is wrong. And it doesn't matter which color does the hating. It's just plain wrong.” 1960年羅馬奧運於次重量級賽事奪冠「令美國變成最強是我的目標，為此我在比賽中擊倒俄羅斯及波蘭的選手，並為美國贏得金牌。」“To make America the greatest is my goal, so I beat the Russian and I beat the Pole. And for the USA won the medal of gold. The Greeks said you're better than the Cassius of old.”  1960年奧運向柏達臣（Floyd Patterson）挑戰「Floyd，終有一日我會將你打敗，因為我是最強的人！」“Hey Floyd - I seen you! Someday I'm gonna whup you! Don't you forget, I am the greatest!” The duels with Frazier傅利沙「傅利沙哭泣的樣子實在太難看了，他的眼淚都流到他的腦後。」“Joe Frazier is so ugly that when he cries, the tears turn around and go down the back of his head.” 政治「拳擊運動，就是大量白人在看兩個男人在台上互相打鬥。」“Boxing is a lot of white men watching two black men beat each other up.” 拒絕為美軍服役「他們（美軍）為甚麼要求我穿上制服，走到離家一萬里外的地方，在越南投擲炸彈以及射殺黃種人。這邊廂在路易斯安那州，卻有一些被叫作黑鬼（Negro）的人受到狗都不如的對待，連基本人權都沒有。」“Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?” 比賽「像蝴蝶般飛舞、像蜜蜂般螫刺」“Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee”
