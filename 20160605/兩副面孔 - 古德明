Lincoln's great love for children easily won their confidence. A little girl, who had been told that the president was very homely, was taken by her father to see the president at the White House. Lincoln took her upon his knee and chatted with her for a while, when she turned to her father and exclaimed,  "Oh, Pa! he isn't ugly at all; he's just beautiful!"But Lincoln was always ready to acknowledge his own homeliness, and he even made jokes about it. When some of his lawyer friends asked him for a photograph, he said,  "I don't know why you boys want such a homely face."  And after being called two-faced in a debate, he said,  "I leave it to my audience. If I had another face, do you think I would wear this one?"林肯很喜歡孩子，因此很容易贏得孩子信任。一個小女孩曾經聽說，林肯總統相貌不揚。有一天，她隨父親去白宮見林肯。林肯把她放在膝上，跟她閑談了一會，她轉身對父親說：「爸爸，他一點都不醜陋，還很漂亮啊！」而林肯從來不否認自己貌寢，甚至以為笑謔。他一些做律師的朋友，跟他索取照片，他說：「真不知你們為什麼要那樣一張難看的臉。」又有一次，在辯論之中，對方說他有兩副面孔，他說：「這個不妨交與聽辯論者判斷。假如我有另一張面孔，還會戴着這一張嗎？」
