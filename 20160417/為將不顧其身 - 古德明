By the end of the Waterloo campaign the only French senior commander remaining undefeated was Marshal Grouchy. The successful retreat of his division to Paris reflected great credit on him and General Vandamme, who was under his command.Vandamme commanded the rearguard, and during the operations he was severely wounded in the belly. Notwithstanding the pain and loss of blood, he remained on horseback, encouraging his men by word and deed. On reaching a village, Vandamme dismounted, and then it was discovered that his breeches were full of blood. A surgeon offered to dress the wound.  "Let me alone," said Vandamme,  "I have something else to do." He immediately began to study the map, and to write his orders. The retreat took altogether eight days.Vandamme died in  1830 at the age of fifty-nine.*滑鐵盧戰役結束時，格魯希元帥是法軍高級指揮官之中唯一沒有戰敗者，率領一師軍隊，安然撤退到巴黎。這對他和他手下的范達將軍來說，是一大榮譽。范達率軍殿後，作戰之中，腹部重創，卻忍着痛楚，不顧血流涔涔，穩坐馬上，用言語，用行動，激厲士氣。到了一條村落，他翻身下馬，大家才發覺他褲子盡為血染。軍醫要給他裹傷，他說：「不要管我，我有其他事情要做。」隨即細看地圖，書寫命令。撤退行程前後共八天。范達一八三零年去世，享年五十九歲。**巴黎凱旋門所刻名字之中，也有范達。
