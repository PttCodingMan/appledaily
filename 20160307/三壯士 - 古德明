The Portuguese Civil War was fought from  1828 to  1834 between those supporting constitutionalism and those keen on absolutism and led by Dom Miguel. In  1832, Dom Miguel laid siege to Oporto. One day during the siege, a major of the Miguelites and two soldiers advanced very gallantly before the rest in an attempt to storm a post held by the constitutionalists, but they were shot dead together with some of those behind them.Some of the defending soldiers went to their colonel, and asked leave to bury them. The colonel was unwilling to grant it, as the Miguelites would even fire on unarmed burying parties."Well, sir," said the men,  "let us at any rate try to bury the brave major and the two lads that lie nearest us. They showed themselves to be good soldiers." This request was granted, and they accomplished their object.一八二八年到一八三四年，葡萄牙內戰，戰爭一方是憲政主義者，另一方是專制主義者，由米格爾一世領導。一八三二年，米格爾一世圍攻波爾圖市。有一天，米格爾軍中一個少校和兩個士兵，奮勇走在其他將士之前，要攻擊憲政主義者扼守的一個陣地，但三人和跟在後面的一些將士都中槍身死。有守軍去見他們的上校，要求把死者埋葬。上校最初頗為猶豫，因為米格爾的軍隊，會不惜向沒有武裝的收葬隊開槍。他手下說：「那麼，上校，至少准許我們收葬那勇敢的少校，以及那兩個少年吧。他們是傑出的軍人，屍體最接近我們的陣地。」上校答應了這個要求，三人也得以安葬。
