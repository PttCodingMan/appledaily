US social reformer Wendell Philips* was campaigning for the abolition of slavery when one day he was accosted by a minister who hailed from the state of Kentucky, a place with very different views concerning the ideas of the Abolitionists. The clergyman said,  "You want to free the niggers, don't you?""Yes, I do.""Well, why do you preach your doctrines up North? Why don't you try coming down to Kentucky?"Philips began to counter-question the man,  "Are you trying to save souls from Hell?""Why yes, sir. That is my business.""Why don't you go there then?"美國社會改革家溫德爾．菲利普斯*為廢除奴隸制度，奔走呼號。有一天，一個肯塔基州來的牧師走到他跟前：肯塔基州人和奴隸制廢除論者之間，意見大有徑庭。那牧師說：「你主張解放黑鬼，對嗎？」「不錯。」「那麼，為什麼在北方宣揚你的主張？為什麼不來肯塔基州？」菲利普斯反唇相稽說：「你是要救人於地獄的嗎？」「啊，不錯，老兄，那是我的職責。」「那麼，你為什麼不去那裏？」*菲利普斯一八三五年開始鼓吹解放黑奴。南北戰爭之後，仍致力為黑人爭取公民權利。
