William Blake, a noted English poet, engraver, and painter, married in  1782 Catherine Boucher, who had fallen in love with him at first sight. He taught this illiterate daughter of a vegetable grower to read and write.Three days before Blake's death in  1827, he was working on the  "Ancient of Days."* He sat bolstered up in bed, and tinted it with his choicest colours. He touched and retouched it, held it at arm's length, and finally, throwing aside the sketch of God measuring the universe, he exclaimed,  "There! That will do! I cannot mend it."  Then his eyes fell on his wife, who had been his companion for so long and who was in tears.  "Stay, Kate!" he said.  "Keep just as you are -- I will draw your portrait, for you have ever been an angel to me."  And so he did, and it was his last work. Unfortunately, the portrait is lost.英國著名詩人、雕刻家、畫家威廉．布雷克一七八二年和凱瑟琳．鮑徹結婚。鮑徹是個菜農的女兒，不識字，對布雷克一見傾心，布雷克教曉她認字寫字。布雷克一八二七年去世之前三天，還在繪畫《永恆之神》。他坐在牀上，以枕頭䇛着身體，用精選的顏色，反覆塗抹，拿着遠看近看，最後，把這幅上帝量度宇宙尺寸的圖畫拋到一旁，說道：「好，行了，不能再修改了。」這時，他看見和他廝守多年的妻子淚眼模糊，就說：「凱瑟，別動，保持這個姿勢，我要給你畫幅肖像。你一直對我那麼好。」他把肖像畫好，而這是他最後一幅作品，可惜現已不存。* The Ancient of Days是《聖經》對上帝的一個稱呼。
