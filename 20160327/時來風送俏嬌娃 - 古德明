When Lauritz Melchior, the preeminent Waynerian tenor of the  1920s,  1930s, and  1940s, was a music student in Munich, he was one day sitting in a garden learning a new opera. He had just sung the lines,  "Come to me, my love, on the wings of light, " when a beautiful girl literally dropped out of the sky at his feet.The girl was Maria Hacker, a Bavarian actress who was making a parachute jump for a film when a gust of wind blew her off course and deposited her in front of the opera singer to his utter astonishment.A few months later, in May  1925, Hacker gave up her career to become Melchior's wife. They were married for  38 years when Hacker died.勞里茨．梅爾基奧爾是一九二零至一九四零年代華格納歌劇出類拔萃的高音歌手。他在慕尼黑進修音樂的時候，有一天坐在花園裏練習一齣新歌劇，剛唱了「愛人啊，快展煌煌雙翼，向我飛來」這一句，一個美麗的女郎真的就從天而降，落在他跟前。那女郎叫瑪麗亞．哈克，來自巴伐利亞省，是個演員，正為電影拍跳傘的一幕，卻給一陣大風吹得偏離旣定降落路線，落在梅爾基奧爾跟前，令他一時目瞪口呆。幾個月之後，即一九二五年五月，哈克告別了拍電影生涯，成為梅爾基奧爾的妻子。他們一起活了三十八年，直到哈克去世。
