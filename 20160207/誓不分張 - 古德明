Mrs Isadore Strauss was one of the few women who went down on the   Titanic  in 1912, and she went down because she could not bear to leave her husband.Both he and she were calm throughout the excitement of loading the lifeboats. Both aided frightened women and children to find places aboard them. Finally, Mr Strauss, who had been urging his wife again and again to seek safety in a lifeboat, forced her to enter one.She was no more seated, however, than she sprang up and got to the deck before her husband could stop her. There, she caught his arm, snuggling it against her side, exclaiming,  "We have been long together through a great many years. We are old now. Where you go, I will go."一九一二年，鐵達尼號沈沒，隨之沈於海底的婦女不多，其一是伊薩多．斯特勞斯太太。她命喪海底，是因為不忍和丈夫分別。救生艇緊急載人逃難時，他們夫婦都很冷靜，還協助驚惶的婦孺登上救生艇。斯特勞斯先生多次叫妻子上艇避難，最後強行要她上了一艘。但斯特勞斯太太才坐下，就跳起來，趁丈夫來不及阻止，回到鐵達尼號甲板上。她抓住丈夫的手臂，把手臂緊貼自己肋窩之下，說道：「我們一起度過了不少日子，現在，你我都老了。你去那裏，我都會跟着去。」
