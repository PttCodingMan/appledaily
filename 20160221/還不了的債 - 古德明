One Reuben Rouzy, of Virginia, owed President Washington £1000, and one of Washington's agents brought an action for the money. As a result, Rouzy, a man with a large family, was taken to jail. Believing that Washington did not know anything of the proceeding, Rouzy sent him a petition. Washington issued an order for his immediate release, together with a full discharge and a severe reprimand to the agent for having acted in such a way.Providence smiled upon the labours of the grateful family, and in a few years Rouzy was able to lay the  £1000, with the interest, at Washington's feet. Washington reminded him that the debt was discharged, but Rouzy said the debt of his family to the father of their country could never be discharged. Washington, to avoid his importunity, accepted the money, only, however, to divide it among Rouzy's children.維吉尼亞州有一位魯本．勞齊，欠總統華盛頓一千鎊。華盛頓一名代理人興訟，勞齊就被抓入獄，遺下家中大群兒女。他想，華盛頓對這次訴訟當無所知，就上書陳情。華盛頓下令把他馬上釋放，債務全部免除，並嚴詞譴責那代理人所作所為。勞齊一家人非常感激，他們辛勤的工作也獲上天眷顧，不過幾年，勞齊就儲足一千鎊，加上利息，送到華盛頓跟前。華盛頓提醒他說，債務早已免除，但勞齊說，他一家欠國家之父的債，永遠無法償清。華盛頓為免他糾纏，收下那筆錢，但馬上把錢分贈勞齊的兒女。
