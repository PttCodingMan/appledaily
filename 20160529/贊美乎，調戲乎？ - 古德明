Lady Randolph Churchill,* mother of Sir Winston Churchill, was canvassing among the voters of Woodstock on behalf of her husband, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer. Interviewing a workingman she asked for his support."No, certainly not," he replied.  "I should never think of voting for a lazy fellow who never leaves his bed until dinner time."The lady assured him that he was wrongly informed, adding,  "As I happen to be his wife, my evidence ought to be conclusive.""Lord, madam," the man at once replied,  "if you were my wife I should never want to get up."倫道夫．邱吉爾夫人*是溫斯頓．邱吉爾的母親。她丈夫任財政大臣期間，她曾在伍德斯托鎮為丈夫拉票，和一個工人談起來，請他支持。那工人說：「不行，絕對不行。我決不會投票支持一個不到晚飯時間不起牀的懶鬼。」邱吉爾夫人告訴他說，他聽到的傳言不正確，並說：「我就是他妻子，我說的當無可置疑。」那工人毫不猶豫回答說：「老天，假如你是我妻子，我恐怕整天都捨不得起牀。」*邱吉爾夫人原名珍妮．傑羅姆（Jennie Jerome），花容月貌，倫道夫．邱吉爾一見傾心，相識僅八個月即金屋迎娶。她為丈夫的政治事業盡心盡力，兒子更在她薰陶之下，成為二十世紀英國最出色政治家。
