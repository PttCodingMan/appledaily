When George V, King of the United Kingdom from  1910 to  1936, was Prince of Wales, he held the rank of lieutenant in the Marines. One day on the afterdeck of a battleship he was conducting drill under the supervision of a senior officer. The deck had been cleared even of its rails. The prince was not well versed in drill and his superior was clearly put out at his awkwardness. At last the squad was marching full on for the stern and the unguarded edge and it seemed as though the prince had either forgotten the command to stop or face about, or else failed to realise the situation.Sputtering with wrath, the officer snapped, as the men neared the edge,  "God Almighty, sir, can't you at least say good-bye to your men!"英王喬治五世一九一零年至一九三六年在位。他還是威爾斯親王的時候，任海軍陸戰隊中尉。有一天，他在戰船船尾甲板上操練士兵，一位高級軍官在旁監督。甲板上一切都已移去，連欄杆都不例外。王子不諳操練之道，指揮笨拙，顯然令他上司十分不滿。最後，整隊士兵邁步向沒有欄杆的船尾走去。王子似乎忘了「止步」或「向後轉」的命令，或根本沒注意到當時的情況。那高級軍官眼看士兵走近沒有圍欄的船舷，氣得發抖，厲聲說：「老天，中尉，你至少也該跟手下說再見吧！」
