Jerome Engel, a noted Baptist preacher, when conducting one of his celebrated revivals in Philadelphia, stopped a small newsboy and asked him the way to the post office."Down this street three squares* and turn to the left.""You seem a bright little fellow," said Engel, a man of considerable self-esteem. "Do you know who I am?""No.""I am the famous preacher who is holding the revival over in the big tabernacle. If you will come to my meeting tonight I will show you the way to Heaven.""Aw, go on," said the youngster,  "you don't even know the way to the post office."傑羅姆．恩格爾是浸信會著名傳教士，曾往費城舉辦他膾炙人口的信仰復興佈道會，在街上叫住一個小報童，問去郵局的道路。「沿着這條街走，過三個街區，然後左轉。」恩格爾向來頗為自負，說道：「你看來是個聰敏的小夥子。知道我是誰嗎？」「不知道。」「我就是在那大禮拜堂舉行信仰復興佈道會的著名傳教士。假如你今晚出席佈道會，我會給你指點往天堂的路。」那小夥子說：「算了吧。你連怎樣去郵局都不知道。」*Square一般譯做「街區」，指四面都有街道圍着的一群建築物。
