It used to be a serious offence for a German soldier to appear in public except in uniform. Even when he was on furlough, he always had to wear it.A certain Lieutenant Schmidt, who was engaged in some adventure or other, dressed up as a civilian, and was having a fine time of it when, on turning a corner, he unexpectedly met his colonel. Lieutenant Schmidt, however, did not lose his presence of mind, but, in a changed voice, asked,  "Can you tell me, sir, where Lieutenant Schmidt lives? I am his brother from the country, and am paying him a visit." The colonel gave the desired information, and Lieutenant Schmidt hurried to his quarters and got into uniform as soon as possible. He thought he had successfully deceived his superior officer, but next day, when he met his colonel, the latter said,  "Lieutenant Schmidt, if your brother from the country pays you another visit, I'll have him placed in close confinement for thirty days!"從前，德國軍人在公眾地方不穿制服，是嚴重違反軍規，即使休假期間也是如此。有個叫施密特的中尉，一天穿上平民服裝，從事些有趣的活動，正自興高采烈，不料轉個街角，赫然碰到軍中的上校。不過，他臨危不亂，裝出另一副聲音，上前問道：「上校，請問知不知道施密特中尉住在那裏？我是他弟弟，從鄉間來探望他。」上校說了地址，他就匆匆回到宿舍，馬上換回軍服，以為騙過了上司。但是，第二天，他碰見上校，上校說：「施密特中尉，令弟下次再從鄉間來探望你，我就會把他囚禁斗室之中三十天！」
