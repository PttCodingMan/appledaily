In the time of the American Revolution, a party of American soldiers encamped at West Point discovered an eagle's nest, half way down a precipice. To get at the nest, a soldier was let down by a rope, fastened round his middle.When he had descended near to the nest, the eagle came upon him, with hideous screams, aiming at his head. He took out his knife, with which he kept her off by striking at her. In one of the passes he made at her, he struck the rope, and cut one of the strands entirely off.In this situation, he every moment expected the rope to part. When he was drawn up to the top of the precipice, the remaining strand of the rope was nearly reduced to a wisp of tow. He was only  25 years old, but in the course of a few hours his raven black hair was changed to the whiteness of wool.美國獨立戰爭期間，一群美國士兵駐紮在西點。他們發現一幅懸崖半腰有個鷹巢，就以繩索環腰，把一個士兵朝着鷹巢吊下去。他將近到達鷹巢的時候，那隻鷹飛來搏擊，叫聲可怕，專攻他頭顱。他拿出小刀，向鷹亂砍，使之不敢飛近，不料有一刀誤中繩索，把其中一股完全砍斷。他就這樣吊在半空，擔心繩索隨時斷成兩截。同袍把他拉回懸崖之上，看那條繩索，未斷的一股也已磨損得只餘一小束纖維。那士兵當時二十五歲，但幾小時之內，他烏黑的頭髮，全變得羊毛一般白。
