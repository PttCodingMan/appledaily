King George V of England and the Princess Victoria, his sister, were accustomed to having a brief chat on the telephone at the same hour every morning. Their conversations were of a highly informal and often joking sort. One morning when her phone rang at the accustomed time, the princess picked up the instrument and said,  "Hello, you old fool."The voice of the operator broke in, saying,  "I beg your pardon, Your Royal Highness. His Majesty is not yet on the line."*　　　　*　　　　*Seeing his young grandson deeply engrossed in his studies, George V gave the youngster a pat on the head and asked,  "And who are you studying about now?""About Perkin Warbeck," was the reply.*"And who was he?""Oh, he was just someone who pretended he was the son of a king. But he wasn't really; he was the son of respectable parents."英國國王喬治五世和妹妹維多利亞公主習慣每天上午定時通電話，閑聊一下，彼此說話都十分隨便，還常開玩笑。一天早上，公主聽見電話在習慣的時間響起鈴聲，拿起來就說：「喂，老笨蛋。」回答的卻是接線生的聲音：「對不起，公主，國王還未來聽電話。」*　　　　*　　　　*喬治五世看見小孫兒聚精匯神讀書，輕拍一下他的腦袋，問道：「你在讀誰人的事迹？」那孩子回答：「珀金．沃貝克。」*「他是誰？」「啊，是個冒牌王子。但他其實不是生於國王之家，而是一禮義之家。」*沃貝克自稱為英王之後，十五世紀末興兵爭位，兵敗身死。
