One day, Jack Johnson, the first African American world heavyweight champion, went into Bradcock's, a fashionable restaurant run by an American Southerner in Mexico City. A waitress told him she had orders not to serve a Negro. He left, but soon returned, accompanied by two Mexican generals.The three of them seated themselves at a table and asked to see Bradcock personally. Bradcock appeared and, noticing the insignia on the uniforms, asked ingratiatingly,  "What can we do for you?""We are asking you to do us the honour of taking coffee with us," said one of the generals, laying his gun on the table.Bradcock tamely sat down. One was never impolite to a Mexican general.Afterwards the generals called a policeman, and Bradcock was fined a hundred pesos for discrimination.美國第一位非裔重量級世界拳王傑克．約翰生有一天走進布拉科克餐廳：這是墨西哥城一家高級餐廳，老闆是美國南部人。女服務員告訴他說，奉命不得招待黑人。約翰生轉身離去，但不久就折回，和他一起的是兩個墨西哥將軍。他們三人坐下，說想見餐廳老闆布拉科克。布拉科克走出來，看見來客軍服上的勳章，就畢恭畢敬問道：「各位要什麼？」一個將軍一邊把手槍放在桌子上，一邊說：「我們想你賞臉，和我們一起喝咖啡。」布拉科克乖乖的坐下來。對一位墨西哥將軍，誰敢無禮。咖啡喝罷，兩位將軍叫來一個警察。布拉科克由於種族歧視，被罰款一百披索。
