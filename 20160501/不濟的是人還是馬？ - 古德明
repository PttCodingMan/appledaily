A troop of yeomanry cavalry undergoing their annual training were being put through the ordinary movements. The inspecting officer noticed that when brought suddenly to a halt, the line was badly kept, many of the horses shooting beyond it. The excuse was made that the horses were not so well trained as those of regular troops. The inspecting officer said that a troop of cavalry would shortly be in the neighbourhood, and that he would see what the volunteers could do when mounted on properly-trained horses.When the day arrived, it was found that the men sat their horses excellently. During a gallop, a halt was suddenly sounded. The well-trained horses at once stopped. The riders, however, did not, but, passing over the horses' heads, fell on the grass like so many bags of sand!一隊英國義務農民騎兵一年一度訓練期間，正在操演，突然奉命停下來。檢閱的軍官發覺，他們停下時，陣線並不整齊，不少馬匹衝越了陣線。騎兵的辯解是：坐騎所受訓練，不及正規騎兵的戰馬。那軍官說，一隊正規騎兵不久將來到附近，到時他會看看農民騎兵騎着受過正式訓練的戰馬，表現怎麼樣。到了那一天，農民騎兵跨上戰馬，熟練非常。他們策馬急馳，「停下」的號令又突然發出。那些戰馬訓練有素，應聲停下；但是，馬上的人卻停不下來，紛紛越過馬頭，像沙包一樣，摔倒在草地上。
