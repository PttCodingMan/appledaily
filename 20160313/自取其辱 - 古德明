John Randolph, who entered the United States House of Representatives in 1799, was a quick thinking orator with a wicked tongue. Once, he had the ill fortune to offend a coxcombish young fellow, who determined to revenge himself by insulting the orator at the first opportunity that occurred.At length the opportunity presented itself, when the young sprig, * meeting Randolph on the pavement, walked up to him very impudently, and said,  "I never give way to a damned rascal."Randolph, immediately pulling off his hat and making the young fellow a low bow, replied,  "Well, sir, I always do," and gave him the pavement.約翰．倫道夫一七九九年成為美國眾議員。他思想敏捷，擅演講，說話可以很刻薄。有一次，他不幸冒犯了一個紈袴少年。那少年有心報復，準備一有機會，就侮辱這個演說家。這機會終於來了：那少年在人行道上，碰見倫道夫，就走到他跟前，態度囂張，說道：「我從來不會讓路給可惡的流氓。」倫道夫馬上脫下帽子，向他深鞠躬，回答說：「嗯，先生，我卻是見之必讓。」說罷，就讓路給那少年。* Sprig一般指「帶花或葉的小枝」，例如a sprig of thyme是「一小枝百里香」。這個字也可以指「年輕人」，多帶輕蔑含義。
