Ralph Emerson had read philosophy, science, poetry, and histories, but none of them had said anything about an effective and harmonious way of pushing a calf into a barn. His son Edward grasped an ear, the father pushed diligently from behind, and together they tried to propel the animal.The calf resisted with calm obstinacy. Emerson's face reddened and perspiring beads gathered on his forehead. And then an Irish servant girl came by. With an amused glance she thrust a finger into the calf's mouth, and the animal, seduced by this maternal imitation, at once followed her into the barn.After cleansing his hands, Emerson wrote in his journal:  "I like people who can do things."雷爾夫．愛默生讀過哲學、科學、詩歌、歷史，但這幾門學科，都沒有提到怎樣才可以和和氣氣驅小牛入牛棚。他兒子愛德華抓着小牛一隻耳朵，他自己則在後面使勁的推，父子合力要那小牛舉步向前。那小牛平靜而固執，寸步不移。愛默生臉都紅了，額頭冒汗。這時，一個愛爾蘭裔女傭走過，看見這情景，眼睛露出笑意，把一隻手指放進小牛口中，此舉頗似母牛之育幼，引得小牛馬上隨她走進牛棚。愛默生洗手之後，在日記簿上寫道：「我喜歡能夠實實在在做事的人。」*愛默生是十九世紀美國詩人及哲學家。
