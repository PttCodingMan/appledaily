Rob Roy MacGregor, the Robin Hood of the Scottish Highlands, was born about 1665, into a bloody and lawless time. His popularity with the poorer folk in the hills enabled him to plunder without fear.It is said that the outlaw, on his deathbed, heard that an old enemy was coming to see him.  "Raise me up, throw my plaid around me and buckle on my arms, then admit him,"  he said.  "No enemy shall see Rob Roy MacGregor defenceless and unarmed." The guest was received with cold civility by the dying man, and in a short time departed."Now all is over," Rob Roy sighed. "Let the piper played 'Ha til mi tulidh (we return no more).'"Before the dirge was done, he was dead.羅布．羅伊．麥格雷戈生於一六六五年左右，是蘇格蘭高地的羅賓漢。當時干戈擾攘，法紀蕩然，而他獲高地貧民愛戴，因此行劫無所忌憚。據說，這個綠林大盜垂死的時候，聽到有個舊敵前來探望。他說：「扶我坐起，披上格子花呢披肩，武器扣掛身上，然後招呼他進來。羅布．羅伊．麥格雷戈不可以給敵人看見身無武器，坐以待斃。」來客獲他禮貌而冷漠的接待，不久就向這垂死的人告辭。羅布．羅伊歎口氣說：「現在，一切都完了。請吹笛人奏一曲《此去不復還》。」輓歌還未奏完，他就一瞑不視。
