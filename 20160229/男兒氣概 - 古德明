The French, in the year  1696, attacked the Iroquois Indians in Canada, who were surprised and routed. An illustrious warrior among them, who was nearly a hundred years of age, either disdaining or not being able to fly, was taken prisoner and abandoned to the savages attached to the French force, who, following their barbarous customs, made him suffer the most horrible torments. The old man did not utter a groan or a sigh, but severely reproached his countrymen for submitting to be the slaves of Europeans, of whom he spoke with the utmost contempt.His invectives irritated one of the spectators, who struck him several blows with a saber to finish him.  "You are wrong," said the intrepid prisoner coolly,  "to shorten my life; you would have had more time to learn how to die like a man."一六九六年，法國軍隊襲擊加拿大的易洛魁印第安人。那些印第安人沒有防備，給殺得落花流水，其中一位傑出戰士，已將近百歲，或是不屑逃跑，或是跑不動，力屈就擒，被交與法軍屬下的蠻人。那些蠻人按照其兇殘習俗，施以酷刑，那老戰士卻沒有呻吟或歎息一聲，只是嚴詞斥責這些同胞甘心做歐洲人的奴隸，言詞對歐洲人極為輕蔑。在場一個蠻人聽到他詈罵，怒從心上起，拿起軍刀，連砍他幾下，要把他砍死。那勇敢的老戰士冷冷說道：「你不該使我速死，否則你會有多點時間，學習怎樣死得具男兒氣概。」
