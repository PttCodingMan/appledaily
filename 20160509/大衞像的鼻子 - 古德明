When Michelangelo had completed his great sculptural work, the David, the Gonfaloniere Soderini of Florence, who had ordered it, came to inspect his purchase. Among his other criticisms he objected to the nose, pronouncing it to be out of all due proportion to the rest of the figure, and added that he wished some reduction should take place in its size.Michelangelo knew well with whom he had to deal. He mounted the scaffold for the figure upwards of twelve feet high, and giving a few sonorous but harmless blows with his hammer on the stone, let fall a handful of marble dust which he had scraped up from the floor below. Then descending from his station he turned to Soderini with a look expectant of his approbation.  "Ay," exclaimed the sagacious critic,  "now you have given it life indeed."米開蘭基羅完成了他的雕刻傑作大衞像之後，佛羅倫斯行政官索代里尼前來察看他訂購的這座雕像，頗有批評，還說雕像的鼻子和其他部分不成比例。他認為那鼻子應該小一點。米開蘭基羅很清楚要應付的是個什麼人物。他爬上高十二英尺雕像的鷹架，用鎚在石上敲了幾下，鎚聲響亮，雕像卻無損。跟着，他撒下手上的大理石屑：那是他爬上鷹架之前在地上撿起的。他爬下鷹架，轉身對着索代里尼，臉上一副期望贊許的表情。那大鑑賞家誇獎道：「好，你這一下，簡直令雕像栩栩如生。」
