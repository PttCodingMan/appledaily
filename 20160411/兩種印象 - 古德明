Woodrow Wilson, the US president who led the nation through World War I, had been asked to receive a delegation of Irish-American leaders, who wished to urge the president to support the cause of Irish Home Rule at the Paris Peace Conference. Wilson had consented to see them, with the proviso that Daniel Cohalan, who had criticised America's declaration of war against Germany, should not accompany them.Nevertheless, the delegation had shown up, headed by Cohalan. Joseph Tumulty, Wilson's private secretary, asked the president to relent.  "This will make a terrible impression on his followers," he said.Wilson was adamant.  "But I think it will make a good impression on decent people," he said.美國總統伍德羅．威爾遜率領國民度過第一次世界大戰。一個愛爾蘭裔美國人代表團要求和他見面陳情，請他在巴黎和會上支持愛爾蘭自治。威爾遜答應見面，但有一個條件：丹尼爾．科希倫不得和他們同來。科希倫曾反對美國向德國宣戰。代表團到來時，領團的卻是科希倫。威爾遜的私人秘書約瑟夫．塔馬爾蒂勸他讓步，說道：「拒絕見科希倫，會給他的支持者一個惡劣印象。」威爾遜不為所動，說道：「但是，卻會給正派的人一個良好印象。」
