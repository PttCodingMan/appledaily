The War of the Spanish Succession was a major European conflict of the  18th century. In  1704, King Louis XIV of France sought to knock Austria out of the war by capturing its capital, Vienna. On  13 August, the French were defeated at Blenheim by the allied British, Dutch and Austrian armies under the British Duke of Marlborough.After the battle, the duke observed a soldier leaning pensively on the butt of his firelock, and asked,  "Why so sad, my friend, after so glorious a victory?""It may be glorious," replied the brave warrior,  "but I am thinking that all the blood I have spilled this day has only earned me fourpence."As the duke turned away from the speaker, a tear was observed to fall from his cheek.西班牙王位繼承戰爭，是十八世紀歐洲國家一場大規模衝突。一七零四年，法國國王路易十四為使奧地利不能再戰，出兵要奪其首都維也納。八月十三日，法軍在布倫海姆被英國馬爾伯勒公爵指揮的英、荷、奧聯軍打敗。戰事之後，馬爾伯勒看見一個士兵倚着燧發槍柄，滿面愁容。他問那士兵：「朋友，剛打了那樣輝煌的一場勝仗，怎麼這樣憂鬱？」那勇敢的戰士回答：「這場勝仗也許很輝煌，但是，我在想，今天我殺了傷了那麼多人，只賺得四便士。」馬爾伯勒轉身離去。有人看見他臉上流下一滴淚水。
