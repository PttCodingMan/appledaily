In Scottish regiments it used to be customary at New Year time for the officers to stand treat to the men, providing substantial dinners. After one such treat, the Scots Greys stationed at Limerick, Ireland, were in the mood for a lark under the effects of alcohol. Some of them therefore secured a few bucketfuls of yellow paint, made their way to O'Connell's monument, and painted the statue a bright orange yellow from head to foot.Next day the natives of Limerick, wild at seeing their patriot transformed into a  "dirty orange boy", and suspecting who were the authors of the mischief, vowed to change the colour of the men of the Scots Greys into black and blue! The authorities intervened, however, and no one was allowed out of barracks that day. At night the Scots Greys were quietly entrained for Dublin.從前，蘇格蘭軍團有一習慣，就是新年期間，軍官會請士兵吃一頓豐富晚宴。有一次，駐守愛爾蘭利莫克市的蘇格蘭灰騎兵宴罷，起了頑童之心。一些士兵乘着酒意，取得幾桶黃色油漆，走到奧康奈爾紀念像之前，把那雕像從頭到腳髹為鮮豔的橙黃色。第二天，利莫克市民看見他們的民族豪傑給變成一個「骯髒橙黃色漢子」，怒不可遏。他們猜到誰是惡作劇者，誓要把蘇格蘭灰騎兵的膚色變成青一塊紫一塊。不過，當局插手，那天不許士兵走出軍營，到了晚上，悄悄送他們上火車去都柏林。
